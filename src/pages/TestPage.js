We believe this provides a great first impression of professionalism for your customer which reflects on your own business. All our vehicles are of late model with many less than 2 years old and are ideal for corporate travel.</p>
        <p className="sec-1-p">Over the past five years, Whiteside Taxis has made a significant commitment to sustainability by investing in the reduction of our carbon footprint. As part of our ongoing efforts, we have successfully transitioned 85% of our fleet to electric hybrid vehicles, ensuring lower emissions and a smaller environmental impact. This year, we are taking our environmental initiatives further by installing a rapid EV charger at our head offices, enabling the seamless integration of fully electric vehicles into our fleet. Once operational, this charger will facilitate the addition of electric vehicles, allowing our clients to enjoy clean, zero-emissions travel. When you choose Whiteside Taxis, you can rest assured that your business journeys are contributing to a greener, more sustainable future.</p>
